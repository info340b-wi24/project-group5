        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>The "Seattle Hangout Guide" is an interactive web application designed to enhance the experience of discovering and
        planning activities in Seattle. Aimed at residents ,tourists ,and students, the app provides a user-friendly platform
        for exploring the city's diverse offerings, from dining to multiple activities like hiking and Axe-throwing. It caters
        to a broad audience, including families, students, and solo travelers, ensuring inclusivity for minority groups. The app
        will especially benefit those new to the city or looking to explore unfamiliar neighborhoods, offering a unique tool to
        enrich their social, cultural experiences, and promote tourism.</p>
        
        <p>Users will interact with the app through features like a personalized itinerary builder, similar to a Google Calendar,
        where they can select activities based on their interests. The 'Activities Wrapped' feature, similar to Spotify Wrapped,
        will offer a fun summary of their explored activities over time. For a social touch, users can share itineraries or
        activity ideas with friends. Additionally, the app includes a feature for users to review activities, enriching the
        community knowledge base. This interactive approach not only personalizes the user experience but also fosters a sense
        of community among Seattle explorers.</p>
        
        <p>The app will leverage APIs like FourSquare Places for detailed information on local venues, ensuring up-to-date and
        relevant content. By offering a centralized platform for discovering and planning activities, the app addresses the
        challenge of scattered information sources, streamlining the process of finding things to do in Seattle. It's not just
        an informational tool but an interactive guide that adapts to user preferences, enhancing their ability to explore the city
        in a personalized way. The use of APIs ensures a dynamic and current data flow, crucial for activities that are
        time-sensitive or dependent on external factors like weather or special events. In solving the problem of fragmented and
        overwhelming choices, the "Seattle Hangout Guide" becomes more than just an app â€“ it's a companion for anyone looking to
        enrich their social and cultural experiences in Seattle. This project, while not driven by business value, showcases
        practical utility and user-centric design, key elements in the field of Informatics.</p>
