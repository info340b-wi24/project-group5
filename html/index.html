        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Our project essentially aims to provide a comprehensive guide for residents and tourists to find activities to do in the Seattle area. As students in Seattle, we commonly hear students talking about how they want activities to do, but that it’s hard to discover events just by word of mouth. Our topic aims to address the issue of finding new ways to spend time in Seattle, as well as helps restaurants and activities gain more exposure and business. 
            One of the main problems related to our topic is that there is no central location for information related to activities in Seattle. 
            In terms of previous solutions, there is currently one app on the market called Stranger Things to Do Seattle. This app claims to offer events calendar on what to do in Seattle and daily suggestions, curated by local experts. However, there are many issues with this existing attempt. It’s currently not being updated anymore, has poor navigation with redirecting from the app to the website, and the interface isn’t user friendly. 
            With our project, we strive to create an app that would improve the lives of Seattle residents by encouraging them to get out of the house more through exciting events, beautiful hikes, and new restaurants. The current solution is insufficient so there is currently a gap in the market, which we are looking forward to filling.
